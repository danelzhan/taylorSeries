            <h1>Taylor's Work with Cambridge</h1>
            <p>
                Although Brook Taylor initially entered Cambridge as a law student, he would do a lot of his work in mathematics there, and worked with John Machin and John Keill as they exchanged thoughts regarding mathematical problems during his undergraduate years and into the rest of his career.

                Taylor also made various visits to France partly due to his health reasons. However, as he was there he met Pierre Rémond de Montmort and they corresponded on a variety of mathematical topics once he had returned from France. Taylor and Montmort particularly discussed infinite series and probability.

            <h1>Work Origins</h1>
            <p>
                Most of Taylor’s discoveries were made as he was researching and learning disciplines in the field of mathematics. However, it can be noted that Taylor got the idea for Taylor’s Theorem from a comment that Machin had made as he suggested using “Sir Issac Newton’s series” to solve Kepler’s problem, and using “Dr Halley’s method of extracting roots” of polynomial equations.
