            <h1>About Brook Taylor</h1>
            <p>
                Brook Taylor was born to John Taylor and Olivia Tempest into a family that was close to nobility and fairly wealthy. He was brought up in a home environment with his father having interests in culture, painting and music. As a result, he developed a love for music and painting during his childhood and further on into his life. He also had private tutors and was educated at home before entering St Johnâ€™s College Cambridge.

                During his time at Cambridge, he became more involved with mathematics. He eventually graduated with an LL.B in 1709, and by this time had already written his first notable mathematical paper (1708) but it would not be published until 1714.

                Although he had his law degree, it is doubtful that he actually practiced as a lawyer. In 1712, he was elected to the Royal Society of London, and eventually elected Secretary in 1714 which is a position he held until 1718 when he resigned. He was also appointed to the committee that was to adjudicate the claim of whether Newton or Leibniz had invented calculus in 1712. He passed away from his declining health in 1731 at the age of 46.
